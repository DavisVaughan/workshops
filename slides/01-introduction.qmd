## Asking for help

üÜò "I'm stuck"

‚ö†Ô∏è "I'm not stuck, but I need help on my computer"

üôã "I need help understanding something"

## Plan for this workshop

-   *Today:* your data budget, what makes a model, evaluating models

-   *Tomorrow:* tuning hyperparameters, feature engineering, case studies

-   Log in to RStudio Cloud üíª (or use your own computer)

-   Introduce yourself to your neighbors üëã

*How are statistics and machine learning related?*

*How are they similar? Different?*


```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 3)
```


::: {.notes}
the "two cultures"

model first vs. data first

inference vs. prediction

## What is tidymodels? `r hexes("tidymodels")`

```{r}
#| message: true
library(tidymodels)
```


##  {background-image="images/tm-org.png" background-size="1000px"}

## The whole game

## Let's install some packages

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "rpart", 
                   "ranger", "vetiver", "rpart.plot"))

## does stacks get installed with tidymodels?

```
