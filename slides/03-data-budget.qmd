## Data splitting and spending

For machine learning, we typically split data into training and test sets:

. . .

-   The **training set** is used to estimate model parameters.
-   The **test set** is used to find an independent assessment of model performance.

. . .

Do not ðŸš« use the test set during training.

## Data splitting and spending

-   Spending too much data in training prevents us from a good assessment of predictive **performance**.

-   Spending too much in testing keeps us from finding a good estimate of model **parameters**.
